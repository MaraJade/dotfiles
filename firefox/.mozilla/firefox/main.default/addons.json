Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":4066,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1561,"reviewCount":1177,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1600891152000},{"id":"{00000f2a-7cde-4f20-83ed-434fcb420d71}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/485/485620-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/485/485620-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/485/485620-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Imagus","version":"0.9.8.74","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3547888/imagus-0.9.8.74-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://tiny.cc/Imagus","supportURL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Imagus/","description":"With a simple mouse-over you can enlarge images and display images/videos from links.","fullDescription":"There are plenty of settings which can be customized, and reviewing them is currently the best way to learn about what the extension is capable of.\n\nSections on the options page, and their brief explanation:\n\n▪ Sieve\nAn expandable set of rules for getting the larger image, media or other content.\nIt has more than 200 rules by default, which support thousands of sites across the web, including the popular ones such as Reddit/Imgur, Wikipedia (or any WikiMedia based site), deviantART, Google services (Images, YouTube, G+, Picasa...), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr...\n\n▪ Grants\nList of user defined rules for blocking/allowing specific sites.","weeklyDownloads":1287,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Deathamns","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/9909304/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/126/126064.png?modified=1543520174","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/126/126064.png?modified=1543520174","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.35,"reviewCount":329,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imagus/reviews/","updateDate":1586771480000},{"id":"{74145f27-f039-47ce-a470-a662b129930a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-32.png?modified=b06fa7ed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-64.png?modified=b06fa7ed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-128.png?modified=b06fa7ed"},"name":"ClearURLs","version":"1.20.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3682334/clearurls-1.20.0-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://clearurls.xyz/","supportURL":"http://wiki.clearurls.xyz","description":"Removes tracking elements from URLs","fullDescription":"This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.\n\nMany websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale) to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.\n\nYou can specify up to 30 sets of sites to block, with different times and days for each set. You can block sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm).\n\nAdditional features:\n\n    Lockdown: Block sites immediately for a specified duration.\n    Access control: Set a password or random access code for the options page, to slow you down in moments of weakness!\n    Delaying: Set a countdown to delay access to sites instead of completely blocking them.\n    Wildcards: Block a range of

Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, facebook, etc.","fullDescription":"uMatrix: A point-and-click matrix-based firewall, with many privacy-enhancing tools.\n\n*For advanced users.*\n\nuMatrix put you in full control of where your browser is allowed to connect, what type of data it is allowed to download, and what it is allowed to execute. Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","weeklyDownloads":1134,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?modified=1543520594","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.png?modified=1543520594","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.
